# B365-Bike-Sharing-Project
Biking programs provide a fun and healthy way for people to commute using bikes. In this project, we run a number of machine learning models on the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset to predict the number of bikes being rented based on weather data and holiday information. We also compare the models with the  r-squared metrics.
